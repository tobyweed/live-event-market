Note about making changes:
Since we can't fork this repo, we can't do pull requests in the traditional way. Thus, whenever one of us wants to make a change, we should create a branch, push it to the repo, and then open a pr asking to merge that branch with master (or whichever branch is being worked in). That way, everybody else can look over your code real quick before merging it.
